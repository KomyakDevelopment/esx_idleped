# Information
This is an advanced idle ped script that you can use
to spawn the desired ped with an idle animation.
All peds spawned are invincible and cannot be harmed.

# How to use
In config.lua you can edit the cordinates & model of your desired ped.

["name"] = This defines the name of the desired ped
["hash"] = This defines the Ped model https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/ped-models/
["pos"] = Is the cordinates of your ped. I recommend using TXAdmin to get cordinates.
["heading"] = Defines where the ped will look towards.

This is an example of how it might look:
